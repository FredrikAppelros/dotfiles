# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

Well, actually, that's not entirely true. This repository does not only contain dotfiles, but also bootstrap scripts that install packages and configure a Debian-based Linux distribution into my liking.

## Installation

Just run the provided installation script, and you should be all set:

    ./install
